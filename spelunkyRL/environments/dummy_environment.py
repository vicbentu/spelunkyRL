"""
Dummy Environment for Testing and Debugging

A minimal environment designed for manual control and testing purposes.

Observation Space:
- Single boolean: can_jump (always returns 1, minimal observation)

Action Space:
- 3-action simplified space: [Movement X, Movement Y, Jump]

Reward Function:
- Always returns 0 (no learning, only for testing)
- Truncates after 90 seconds

Reset Options:
- manual_control=True: Allows keyboard control of the game
- god_mode=True: Player is invulnerable
- No entities destroyed

Use Cases:
- Testing game mechanics manually
- Debugging game state
- Observing game behavior without RL
